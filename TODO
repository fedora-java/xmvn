* User-visible features

** Use cache manager instead of storing stuff in /tmp

* Internal features

** Test cases for XMvn Bisect

** Regression tests for fixed bugs

   Bugs in Bugzilla marked with NeedsTestCase keyword.

** Reduce usage of RuntimeExceptions

   Use checked exceptions in favor of unchecked RuntimeException.

* Random ideas (no milestone assigned)

** plugin API

* Deferred features

** improved configuration

*** final fields
    some configuration settings cannot be overridden by offspring
    configuration files

*** configuration from pluginManagement
    just like Eclipse M2E does

*** singleton configurator
    configurator should generate configuration once and cache it

*** in tests don't modify configuration directly
    clone it and customize the clone

** improve compat package resolver
   maybe version ranges, maybe number of matching components
